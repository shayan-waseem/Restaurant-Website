Food Website

A food website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask framework, and Python. It includes essential pages like **Home**, **Menu**, **Register**, **Login**, and **About Us**. The project aims to provide a simple yet effective platform for users to explore food options, register accounts, log in, and learn about the website's purpose.

Features

- **Menu Page**: Displays a list of food items with detailed descriptions.
- **Register Page**: Allows new users to sign up by providing their details.
- **Login Page**: Allows registered users to log in with their credentials.
- **About Us Page**: Provides information about the website and its mission.

Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the pages.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content and interactivity on the frontend.
- **Flask (Python)**: For backend development, handling routes, and managing user sessions.
